# Surfs Up

## Overview/Purpose of Analysis

The purpose of this analysis is to determine temperature statistics for months June and December to identify if the Surfs Up shop in Oahu can be operational year-round. We collected data by running two seperate queries, one for the month of June and one for December, and stored the temperatures in a list where they were then converted into a dataframe. 

## Results

- For the month of December, the total count was 1517, mean was 71, minimum was 56 and maximum was 83

- There is a difference of 0.5 in the standard deviation between the two months (December was 3.75 and June was 3.25)

## Summary

The data from our analysis shows that the precipitation means for both months are somewhat close and the temperature difference isn't too great. This tells us that the Surfs Up shop in Oahu can be operational year round. In addition, we can perform more queries to determine the best location for the shop and determine how many potential customers there could be in various locations.
